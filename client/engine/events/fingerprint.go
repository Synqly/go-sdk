// The Fingerprint object provides detailed information about a digital fingerprint, which is a compact representation of data used to identify a longer piece of information, such as a public key or file content. It contains the algorithm and value of the fingerprint, enabling efficient and reliable identification of the associated data.
type Fingerprint struct {
	// The hash algorithm used to create the digital fingerprint, normalized to the caption of 'algorithm_id'. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source.
	Algorithm *string `json:"algorithm,omitempty"`
	// The identifier of the normalized hash algorithm, which was used to create the digital fingerprint.
	AlgorithmId FingerprintAlgorithmId `json:"algorithm_id,omitempty"`
	// The digital fingerprint value.
	Value FileHash `json:"value"`
