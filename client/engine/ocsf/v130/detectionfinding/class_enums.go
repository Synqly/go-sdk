// ActionId Values
// Action ID. The action taken by a control or other policy-based system leading to an outcome or disposition. Dispositions conform to an action of <code>1</code> 'Allowed' or <code>2</code> 'Denied' in most cases. Note that <code>99</code> 'Other' is not an option. No action would equate to <code>1</code> 'Allowed'. An unknown action may still correspond to a known disposition. Refer to <code>disposition_id</code> for the outcome of the action.
